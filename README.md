**A production-grade, secure cloud file storage platform built entirely with Infrastructure as Code**

*Deployed on Microsoft Azure | South Africa North Region*

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates the design and implementation of a production-grade secure file storage platform on Microsoft Azure, built to align with Zero Trust security principles and enterprise cloud governance standards.

The solution simulates a real-world regulated environment where sensitive data must be protected against unauthorized access, misconfiguration, and exposure. A secure-by-design approach is applied throughout, ensuring that all resources are deployed with strict security controls, private network access, and identity-based authentication.

Infrastructure is provisioned entirely using Terraform, enabling consistent, repeatable, and version-controlled deployments. The platform incorporates centralized secrets management, continuous monitoring, backup and disaster recovery, and cost governance — reflecting the core requirements of modern cloud environments in financial services and other regulated industries.

This implementation highlights a strong focus on risk reduction, operational visibility, and audit readiness, demonstrating how cloud platforms can be securely deployed and managed at an enterprise level.

## Security Implementation

### Zero Trust Principles Applied

**1. Never Trust, Always Verify**
- All access to storage requires identity verification
- No anonymous or public access permitted
- Azure AD-based authentication enforced

**2. Least Privilege Access**
- RBAC roles assigned at minimum required permissions
- Service principals scoped to specific subscriptions
- Key Vault access policies restrict who can read secrets

**3. Assume Breach**
- Private Endpoint removes public internet attack surface
- Network rules deny all traffic by default (`default_action = "Deny"`)
- Only Azure services explicitly bypassed
- TLS 1.2 minimum enforced on all connections

### Network Security
```
Internet ──✗──> Storage Account    (Public access BLOCKED)
VNet ──────────> Private Endpoint ──> Storage Account (ALLOWED)
```

### Encryption
- **In transit**: TLS 1.2 minimum on all connections
- **At rest**: Azure Storage Service Encryption (AES-256)
- **Key management**: Azure Key Vault with soft delete protection

---

## Disaster Recovery & Backup

| Feature | Configuration |
|---------|--------------|
| Storage Replication | GRS (Geo-Redundant Storage) — data replicated to secondary Azure region |
| Blob Soft Delete | 30-day retention — deleted files recoverable |
| Blob Versioning | Enabled — previous versions preserved |
| Recovery Services Vault | Standard SKU with soft delete enabled |
| Key Vault Soft Delete | 7-day retention on deleted secrets |

---

## Monitoring & Alerting

- **Log Analytics Workspace**: Centralises all resource logs and metrics
- **Action Group**: Email notifications to administrator
- **Retention**: 30 days of log data
- **Budget Alerts**: Email at 80% and 100% of monthly spend

## Challenges & Solutions

| Challenge | Solution |
|-----------|---------|
| Git submodule conflict in terraform folder | Removed `.git` directory from subfolder, re-tracked files |
| GitHub Actions YAML syntax errors | Iterative debugging, restructured env variable injection |
| Azure CLI authentication in CI/CD | Implemented service principal with scoped RBAC permissions |
| Terraform state management | Established proper `.gitignore` to exclude sensitive state files |
| Network lockdown breaking access | Configured `bypass = ["AzureServices"]` to allow Azure-internal traffic |

---

## Key Learnings

- **Infrastructure as Code** — Terraform enables repeatable, version-controlled deployments
- **Zero Trust Architecture** — Security must be designed in, not bolted on
- **Private Networking** — Private Endpoints completely eliminate public attack surface
- **Secrets Management** — Key Vault is the correct way to handle credentials in Azure
- **Cost Awareness** — Budget alerts prevent surprise bills in cloud environments
- **Disaster Recovery** — GRS replication and soft delete are essential for production data

- ## Live Deployment Evidence

All resources below are deployed live in Microsoft Azure — 
South Africa North region. Screenshots taken directly 
from the Azure Portal.

### 1. Resource Group Overview

> Complete resource group `rg-securefiles` showing all 
> deployed infrastructure components including Virtual Network, 
> Storage Account, Key Vault, Private Endpoint, Log Analytics 
> Workspace, Recovery Services Vault, and Budget Alert — 
> all provisioned via Terraform in a single automated deployment.
> <img width="1366" height="731" alt="Resource Group Overview" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c0b8d406-23d4-4238-88a0-1bb0ae706570" />

 ---

### 2. Virtual Network & Subnets

> Private Virtual Network `vnet-securefiles` configured with 
> address space 10.0.0.0/16 and dedicated subnet 
> `snet-privateendpoints` (10.0.1.0/24) for secure 
> Private Endpoint connectivity. No public-facing 
> network interfaces deployed.
<img width="1366" height="731" alt="Virtual Network" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2bd10251-b653-4771-9a95-77626ae04dcc" />

---

### 3. Private Endpoint

> Private Endpoint `pe-stsecurefiles` creates a private 
> network interface inside the Virtual Network, routing all 
> storage traffic through the internal network. Public internet 
> access to the storage account is completely eliminated — 
> a core Zero Trust security requirement.
> <img width="1366" height="732" alt="Private Endpoint" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d89dcc09-f69b-476d-b42a-e0fec4876eb3" />


---

### 4. Storage Account — Network Security

> Storage account `stsecurefiles001` with public network 
> access disabled and firewall rules set to Deny by default. 
> Only Azure Services are explicitly bypassed. Combined with 
> the Private Endpoint, this eliminates the storage account 
> from the public internet attack surface entirely.
> <img width="1366" height="727" alt="Storage Account Network Settings" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1b6f4291-3acb-46b6-8c4d-b451394fcaa1" />


---

### 5. Azure Key Vault

> Key Vault `kv-securefiles-001` deployed as the centralised 
> secrets and encryption key store. Access policies restrict 
> key and secret operations to authorised identities only. 
> Soft delete protection enabled with 7-day retention — 
> prevents accidental or malicious permanent deletion of 
> cryptographic material.
> <img width="1366" height="733" alt="Key Vault" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ef3c734d-e221-4fbd-b675-ab982adbc0f5" />


---

### 6. Recovery Services Vault

> Recovery Services Vault `rsv-securefiles` provides the 
> backup and disaster recovery foundation. Combined with 
> Geo-Redundant Storage (GRS) replication on the storage 
> account, data is automatically replicated to a secondary 
> Azure region — ensuring business continuity in the event 
> of a regional outage.
> <img width="1366" height="725" alt="Recovery Services Vault" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d96d4d6f-45c9-400f-9b33-d9199ce06e95" />


---

### 7. Log Analytics Workspace

> Centralised Log Analytics Workspace `law-securefiles` 
> collects diagnostic logs and metrics from all deployed 
> resources. 30-day log retention configured. Connected to 
> Azure Monitor Action Group for automated email alerting — 
> forming the observability layer of the platform.
> <img width="1366" height="731" alt="Log Analytics Workspace" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/eaac9ae0-94de-4442-bc2a-40c97d2ad4bc" />


---

### 8. Microsoft Defender for Cloud

> Microsoft Defender for Cloud security posture assessment 
> showing active recommendations and security score for the 
> subscription. Defender provides continuous security 
> monitoring, misconfiguration detection, and threat 
> intelligence across all deployed Azure resources.
> <img width="1366" height="729" alt="Microsoft Defender for Cloud" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0aac088d-655f-4a8c-b16a-3d9fd9f8a78f" />


---

### 9. Budget Alert — Cost Management

> Azure Cost Management budget `budget-securefiles` configured 
> at $50/month with automated email notifications triggered 
> at 80% ($40) and 100% ($50) of monthly spend. Demonstrates 
> FinOps awareness and cost governance — a requirement in 
> every enterprise cloud environment.
> <img width="1366" height="731" alt="Budget Alert" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/629a4ba8-7139-4ff0-be31-8718382b3e6e" />
